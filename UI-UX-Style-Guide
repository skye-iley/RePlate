TO DO - Write a short paragraph about how we lay out our program, once we have actually designed it, and how that layout works with differing screen orientations/sizes.


Component Behavior: (what happens when you hover? What happens when you click? What happens when it's the active component? What happens when you change the value?)
BE SURE TO INCLUDE ANY HOVER EFFECTS, TRANSITIONS, OR ANIMATIONS!!!!
